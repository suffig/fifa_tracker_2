# Tab Switch and Reload Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The FIFA Tracker application was losing connection to Supabase after tab switches or CTRL+F5 reloads, causing:
- No data loading after tab becomes visible again
- Loss of real-time synchronization
- No communication with Supabase despite valid auth session
- App UI remaining active but non-functional

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was that the `visibilitychange` event handler was commented out in `main.js` at line 341:
```javascript
//document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
```

This handler is responsible for:
1. Cleaning up Supabase subscriptions when tab becomes hidden
2. Reinitializing connections when tab becomes visible
3. Resetting data states and reestablishing real-time subscriptions

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enable Visibility Change Handler
**File:** `main.js` (line 352)
**Change:** Uncommented the visibility change event listener
```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
```

### 2. Fix Race Condition in Initialization
**File:** `main.js` (lines 27, 277-355)
**Problem:** Multiple concurrent calls to `renderLoginArea()` could cause conflicts
**Solution:** Added `isInitializing` flag with try-finally pattern
```javascript
let isInitializing = false;

async function renderLoginArea() {
    if (isInitializing) {
        console.log("renderLoginArea already initializing, skipping...");
        return;
    }
    
    isInitializing = true;
    try {
        // ... initialization logic
    } finally {
        isInitializing = false;
    }
}
```

### 3. Fix Tab Button Initialization Logic
**File:** `main.js` (lines 294-302)
**Problem:** `tabButtonsInitialized` flag was checked after it was set, always resulting in same code path
**Solution:** Store previous state before calling `setupTabButtons()`
```javascript
const wasTabButtonsInitialized = tabButtonsInitialized;
setupTabButtons();
// ... other setup
if (!wasTabButtonsInitialized) {
    switchTab(currentTab);
} else {
    renderCurrentTab();
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Visibility Change Handler
**File:** `main.js` (lines 94-122)
**Improvements:**
- Added small delay (100ms) to ensure tab is fully active
- Better error handling with try-catch
- Improved logging for debugging
- More robust session validation

```javascript
setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
        const {data: {session}} = await supabase.auth.getSession();
        if(session) {
            console.log('Tab became visible - reinitializing app with session');
            // Reset states and reinitialize...
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error during tab visibility reinitialization:', error);
        renderLoginArea();
    }
}, 100);
```

## How It Works

### Tab Switch Scenario:
1. User switches away from tab → `document.hidden = true`
2. `handleVisibilityChange()` triggers cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity
3. User switches back to tab → `document.hidden = false`
4. `handleVisibilityChange()` detects tab is visible again
5. After 100ms delay, reinitialization begins:
   - Session validation
   - Data state reset (all modules)
   - Tab button setup
   - Supabase subscription reestablishment
   - Current tab data reload

### CTRL+F5 Reload Scenario:
1. Page reloads completely
2. `DOMContentLoaded` event fires
3. `renderLoginArea()` called with race condition protection
4. Auth state validation
5. Full app initialization if session exists

## Benefits
- **No hard reload required**: App automatically recovers after tab switches
- **Reliable Supabase reconnection**: Real-time subscriptions are reestablished
- **Data consistency**: All local data states are reset and reloaded
- **Race condition prevention**: Multiple initialization attempts are prevented
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallback to login if reinitialization fails

## Testing
Created verification test (`test_visibility.html`) that simulates tab switches and confirms:
- Visibility change handler registration
- Proper cleanup on tab hide
- Successful reinitialization on tab show
- Error-free execution flow

The fix ensures the FIFA Tracker app remains fully functional after tab switches or reloads without requiring manual page refresh.
